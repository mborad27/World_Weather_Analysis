# Analysis of the World: Weather and Travel with APIs
## Overview
PlanMyTrip is a new app that focuses on internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. We collected data for customers using the "search" function which enables them to filter based on their preffered travel critera to find their perfect hotel. In addition, weather data was collected through the Open Weather Map API and added to the Pandas data frame. 

Jack, the head of Analysis, is thrilled with these new changes, and suggested a few more: he would appreciate for us to add the weather description to the weather data that was previously retrieved. This would help beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences. With this information, they will be able to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. They will select 4 cities to create a travel itinerary. With Google Maps Directions API, we will a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
